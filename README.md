# Jenkins WebHook plugin

Outbound WebHook for Jenkins build events


## Compile

./gradlew build


## Test

./gradlew test


## Run server

./gradlew server

Visit http://localhost:8080

The frist time you visit it, you are required to go through the setup process.
Please don't install any third-party plugins. This plugin we currently working on will be installed by default.


## Admin user

I use the following credential for testing:

admin/admin

Of course you don't have to copy my example.


## todo

- Rename package
